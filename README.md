Here are all the files you need to create your own dog tracker!
Follow these steps and everything should work:

Put index.php and update.php in your servers /www/ folder and create an empty text file named "latLong.txt" in the same directory.

Configure your server so that prowlNotification.py runs in the background at startup.

Upload the arduino file onto your Teensy 2.0 board and wire everything up.
